TECHNOLOGOIES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have developed the applicaion using followings as core component 
	.NET Core -- to alow the mximum portability
	WebApi -- to allow RESTful API to make the application available for use in any platform such as web, mobile app without requiring any changes.
	Token based authenticaiton -- best approah for Restful API authentication
	Dapper 
	Structuremap -- Dependency injection
	

SETUP
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open in Visual Studio 2017
Find the dtabase mdf and ldf file in Database folder and change ConnectionStirng accordingly in appsettings.json
I have attached Postman collecttion to make testing easy.
Use postman to 
	RegisterRefree, 
	RegisterMember, 
	UserLogin, 
	CreateCompetitor, 
	CreateContest, 
	SaveMatchResult, 
	GetPublicLeaderboard, 
	MakeLeaderboardPublic, 
	GetAllLeaderboard


ASSUMPTIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Each contest should have tournament so the leaderboard can be requested per Tournament.
Same competitor may participant in different tournament.
No tournament details are stored at thsi stage, only tournament id is used for the time being
Leaderboard is being at lowest level so that the leaderboard data can be broken down and bound according to the request
Instead of storing point, I have stored the match result agains each competitor per contest so that the point can be made configurable
